Database Connection Management - Backend Pattern
===============================================

üéì **EDUCATIONAL OVERVIEW:**
This module demonstrates Flask's request-scoped database connection pattern,
an approach used in applications for efficient resource management.

üèóÔ∏è **KEY CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:**
1. Request-Scoped Connections - Flask's 'g' object pattern
2. Connection Management - Reusing connections efficiently  
3. Resource Management - Automatic cleanup and teardown
4. SQLite Integration - Database patterns
5. Row Factory - Enhanced result handling with dictionary-like access

üéØ **INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:**
- "I use Flask's g object for request-scoped database connections to optimize performance"
- "This pattern prevents connection leaks and reduces database overhead"
- "Row factory provides dictionary-like access to query results"
- "Automatic cleanup ensures resources are properly released"

    üîó REQUEST-SCOPED DATABASE CONNECTION
    ====================================
    
    Get database connection using Flask's request-scoped 'g' object.
    
    üìö **WHAT IS FLASK'S 'g' OBJECT?**
    Flask's 'g' object is a request-scoped storage mechanism that persists
    data for the duration of a single request across all functions called.
    
    üéØ **WHY USE REQUEST-SCOPED CONNECTIONS?**
    1. **Performance**: Reuses connection within a single request
    2. **Resource Efficiency**: Prevents creating multiple connections per request
    3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Connection is automatically cleaned up after request
    4. **Thread Safety**: Each request gets its own connection
    5. **Common Pattern**: Used in Flask applications
    
    üîÑ **CONNECTION LIFECYCLE:**
    1. First call in request ‚Üí Create connection, store in g.db_conn
    2. Subsequent calls ‚Üí Return existing connection from g.db_conn  
    3. End of request ‚Üí Flask calls teardown handler to close connection
    
    üìñ **INTERVIEW EXPLANATION:**
    "I use Flask's g object to store database connections per request. This ensures
    efficient resource usage by reusing connections within a request while
    automatically cleaning them up when the request ends."

    # Check if connection already exists in this request's context

        # üîß **POSTGRESQL CONNECTION DETAILS:**
        # - Uses DATABASE_URL environment variable for flexibility
        # - RealDictCursor provides dictionary-like access to results
        # - Connection persists for entire request lifecycle

    """
    üéØ DATABASE CURSOR FACTORY
    ==========================
    
    Get database cursor from the request-scoped connection.
    
    üìö **WHAT IS A DATABASE CURSOR?**
    A cursor is an object that allows you to execute SQL statements and fetch results.
    It's the interface between your Python code and the database.
    
    üéØ **WHY USE A CURSOR FACTORY?**
    1. **Consistency**: All database operations use the same connection
    2. **Simplicity**: One function call gets you a ready-to-use cursor
    3. **RealDictCursor Benefits**: Results accessible as dictionaries
    4. **Common Pattern**: Standard practice in Flask applications
    
    üìñ **INTERVIEW EXPLANATION:**
    "This factory function provides a consistent way to get database cursors
    that are connected to our request-scoped connection. Using RealDictCursor
    makes the results easier to work with by providing dictionary-like access."
    
    Returns:

    # Get cursor from the request-scoped connection
    # The cursor inherits Row factory from the connection

    üßπ REQUEST CLEANUP HANDLER
    ==========================
    
    Close database connection at the end of each request.
    
    üìö **FLASK TEARDOWN PATTERN:**
    This function is registered as a teardown handler with Flask.
    Flask automatically calls it at the end of every request.
    
    üéØ **WHY AUTOMATIC CLEANUP?**
    1. **Resource Management**: Prevents connection leaks
    2. **Memory Efficiency**: Frees up database connections
    3. **Reliability**: Guaranteed cleanup even if errors occur
    4. **Common Practice**: Standard pattern in applications
    
    üîÑ **CLEANUP PROCESS:**
    1. Extract connection from g object (if it exists)
    2. Close the connection if one was created
    3. Connection is removed from g object automatically
    
    üìñ **INTERVIEW EXPLANATION:**
    "This teardown handler ensures database connections are properly closed
    after each request. It's registered with Flask to run automatically,
    providing reliable resource cleanup even if errors occur."
    
    Args:
        error: Any error that occurred during the request (unused but required by Flask)

    üèóÔ∏è FLASK APPLICATION INTEGRATION
    ================================
    
    Initialize database connection management with Flask application.
    
    üìö **APPLICATION FACTORY INTEGRATION:**
    This function integrates our database connection pattern with a Flask app
    created using the application factory pattern.
    
    üéØ **REGISTRATION PROCESS:**
    Registers the close_db function as a teardown handler, ensuring it runs
    after every request to clean up database connections.
    
    üìñ **INTERVIEW EXPLANATION:**
    "This function integrates our database connection management with the Flask
    application by registering our cleanup handler. This ensures proper resource
    management across the entire application lifecycle."

    """

# üéØ **ADVANCED PATTERNS FOR INTERVIEW DISCUSSION:**
# =================================================
# 
# üí° **CONNECTION POOLING:**
# In high-traffic production applications, you might use connection pooling:
# 
# from psycopg2 import pool
# 
# class DatabasePool:
#     def __init__(self, min_conn=1, max_conn=10):
#         self.pool = psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool(
#             min_conn, max_conn, DATABASE_URL
#         )
# 
# üí° **TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT:**
# For complex operations, you might add transaction support:
# 
# @contextmanager
# def get_db_transaction():
#     conn = get_db_connection()
#     try:
#         yield conn.cursor()
#         conn.commit()
#     except Exception:
#         conn.rollback()
#         raise
# 
# üí° **DATABASE HEALTH CHECKS:**
# Production applications often include health check endpoints:
# 
# def check_database_health():
#     try:
#         cursor = get_db_cursor()
#         cursor.execute('SELECT 1')
#         return True
#     except Exception:
#         return False
