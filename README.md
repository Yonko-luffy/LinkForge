## 📊 **Database Schema**

### **Users Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Links Table (All Features)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE links (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    original_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    short_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,       -- Format: username/custom-code
    display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT DEFAULT NULL,       -- Password protection
    expiration_date TEXT DEFAULT NULL,     -- Link expiration
    clicks INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);
```

### **Clicks Table (Analytics)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE clicks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    link_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    ip_address TEXT,
    referrer TEXT DEFAULT 'Direct',
    user_agent TEXT DEFAULT '',
    clicked_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (link_id) REFERENCES links (id)
);
```

## 🎯 **Interview Talking Points**

### **Architecture Questions:**
> **"Why did you choose Flask blueprints?"**
> 
> "I used Flask blueprints to organize the application into logical modules - auth for user management, links for core functionality, and main for static pages. This separation makes the code more maintainable and allows different team members to work on different features independently."

### **Problem-Solving Questions:**
> **"How did you solve the URL collision problem?"**
> 
> "I implemented personal namespaces where each user gets their own URL space. Instead of competing for `/portfolio`, users get `/alice/portfolio` and `/bob/portfolio`. This eliminates conflicts while creating branded, memorable URLs."

### **Technical Deep-Dive:**
> **"Explain your dynamic link feature."**
> 
> "The core innovation is that all links are dynamic by default. Users can change the destination URL anytime without breaking the short link. This is implemented with a simple database update that changes the `original_url` field while keeping the `short_code` constant."

### **Security Considerations:**
> **"How do you handle security?"**
> 
> "I implement multiple security layers: password hashing with Werkzeug's PBKDF2-SHA256, parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection, server-side input validation, secure session management, and password protection for sensitive links."

# LinkForge - Magnum Interview Q&A Guide

---

## What is LinkForge?
**Q:** What is LinkForge and what problem does it solve?
**A:** LinkForge is a dynamic URL shortener and QR code generator. It solves the problem of URL collisions and static links by giving every user their own namespace (e.g., `/username/project`). All links are dynamic, meaning users can change where their short links redirect at any time without breaking existing shares.

---

## How does LinkForge handle user authentication?
**Q:** How are users registered and authenticated?
**A:** LinkForge uses a custom authentication system built with Flask. Users register with a username, email, and password. Passwords are securely hashed before storage. Login checks credentials and sets a session for the user.

---

## What are dynamic links?
**Q:** What does "dynamic link" mean in this project?
**A:** Dynamic links allow users to change the destination URL of a short link at any time. The short code remains the same, so bookmarks and shares never break, but the redirect target can be updated from the dashboard.

---

## How does LinkForge prevent link collisions?
**Q:** How does LinkForge ensure unique short links for each user?
**A:** Each user has their own namespace. For example, `/alice/project` and `/bob/project` are both valid and independent. This prevents collisions and allows users to organize their links freely.

---

## What security features are implemented?
**Q:** How does LinkForge protect user data and links?
**A:** LinkForge uses a strong Flask `SECRET_KEY` for session security, hashes all passwords, and enforces security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy). CORS is enabled to control cross-origin requests. Password protection and link expiration are available for sensitive links.

---

## How are QR codes generated and managed?
**Q:** How does the QR code feature work?
**A:** Every short link automatically gets a QR code, generated using the `qrcode` Python library. Users can view, download, and bulk download QR codes from the dashboard. QR codes use a dark theme for better scanning.

---

## What analytics are available?
**Q:** What kind of analytics does LinkForge provide?
**A:** LinkForge tracks clicks for each link, including timestamp, referrer, and user agent. Users can view total clicks, active/expired links, and export analytics as CSV files.

---

## How is the project structured?
**Q:** What is the codebase structure?
**A:** The project uses Flask blueprints for modularity:
- `blueprints/auth.py`: Authentication
- `blueprints/links.py`: Link management
- `blueprints/main.py`: Landing and static pages
- `models.py`: Database operations
- `config.py`: Configuration management
- `static/`: CSS and JS
- `templates/`: Jinja2 HTML templates

---

## How do you configure and deploy LinkForge?
**Q:** How is configuration managed?
**A:** All secrets and config values are stored in a `.env` file (never committed to public repos). The app loads these using environment variables. For deployment, set `FLASK_ENV=production`, a strong `SECRET_KEY`, and use a production WSGI server.

---

## What are best practices for security and deployment?
**Q:** What steps should be taken before deploying?
**A:**
- Set a strong, random `SECRET_KEY` in `.env`
- Set `FLASK_ENV=production` and `FLASK_DEBUG=False`
- Enable `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` for HTTPS
- Use `.gitignore` to keep secrets and unnecessary files out of the repo
- Review security headers and CORS settings
- Use a production database if scaling up

---

## What makes LinkForge unique?
**Q:** What are the standout features?
**A:**
- Personal namespaces for every user
- Dynamic links (change destinations anytime)
- Built-in QR code generation and bulk download
- Password protection and link expiration
- Full analytics and export
- Modern, minimal UI with pure CSS and minimal JS

---

## How would you explain LinkForge to a non-technical interviewer?
**Q:** Can you summarize LinkForge in simple terms?
**A:** LinkForge is a tool that lets anyone create short, memorable links and QR codes for their content. Unlike other shorteners, you can update your links anytime, keep your own namespace, and track how many people use your links—all with strong security and privacy.

---

## How do you run and test the project locally?
**Q:** What are the steps to run LinkForge locally?
**A:**
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a `.env` file with your secrets
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run: `python app.py`
5. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

---

## What technologies are used?
**Q:** What is the tech stack?
**A:**
- Python 3.11+
- Flask (web framework)
- SQLite (default database)
- Jinja2 (templates)
- qrcode (QR code generation)
- Flask-CORS (CORS protection)
- Pure CSS and minimal JavaScript

---

## How do you handle environment variables and secrets?
**Q:** Where are secrets stored?
**A:** All secrets (like the Flask `SECRET_KEY`) are stored in a `.env` file, which is ignored by git. This keeps sensitive data out of the codebase and public repos.

---

## What would you improve if you had more time?
**Q:** What are possible future improvements?
**A:**
- Add support for PostgreSQL or MySQL for scalability
- Implement OAuth login (Google, GitHub)
- Add custom analytics dashboards
- Improve mobile UI and accessibility
- Add API endpoints for programmatic link creation

---

## How do you ensure code quality and maintainability?
**Q:** What practices help keep the codebase clean?
**A:**
- Modular blueprints for separation of concerns
- Environment-based configuration
- Use of `.gitignore` and `.env` for secrets
- Clear comments and docstrings throughout the code
- Minimal dependencies for easy deployment

---

## Any other tips for interviews?
**Q:** How should you present LinkForge?
**A:** Focus on the unique features (dynamic links, personal namespaces, QR codes, analytics), your attention to security, and your understanding of deployment best practices. Be ready to explain why each design choice was made and how you would improve the project further.
